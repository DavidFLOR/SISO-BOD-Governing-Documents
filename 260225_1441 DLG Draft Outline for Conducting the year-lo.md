Draft Outline for Conducting the year-long effort to update the SISO Governing Documents

The hierarchy of governing documents and constraints for SISO, Inc, a not-for-profit Florida Corporation
    Statutes:  Florida Statutes for not-for-profit Corporations 
    Statutes:  U.S. Internal Revenue Services legal requirements for not-for-profit Corporations
    Articles of Incorporation
    By-Laws
    Standing Resolutions of the SISO Inc. Board of Directors
    Motions and any other approved actions of the SISO Inc. Board of Directors

General Plan
    First, finish the conversion of the PDF version of the By-Laws to an editable document in Microsoft Word and/or Google Docs
    Second, re-organize for clarity and bring up to date the existing Microsoft Word file of the Standing Resolutions
    Third, create a working group to explore what changes to the By-Laws and/or Standing Resolutions the current Board of Directors considers to be recommended to bring the SISO Inc. governance more up to date, i.e. more in line with current communication methods, available tools and the like

[Note to self; just edited this file directly in the Github repo to make sure that works with a .MD file]
