# SISO-BOD-Governing-Documents
An experimental repository for developing a way to collaborate on the project to clean up and de-conflict SISO's governing documents, specifically the Articles of Incorporation; By-Laws; and Standing Resolutions of the SISO Board of Directors
Originally setup as public so existing BOD members who don't have Github accounts can explore; will switch to private before any actual collaboration to beging changing governing documents
